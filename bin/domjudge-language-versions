## first attempt copying where I translated command from docker-compose.yml file

# notes: 
#  - cgroup volume binding not needed for checking versions
#  - however we still need priviliged rights to run /opt/domjudge/judgehost/bin/dj_run_chroot to do chroot
#  - MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 is needed when running docker command on bash on msys on windows to prevent it 
#    to automatically converting Linux looking paths to their Windows equivalent.
#  - for running scripts we do not need  an interactive terminal (no -it option)

# improved versions working on all platforms with docker without needing to enable cgroup in kernel

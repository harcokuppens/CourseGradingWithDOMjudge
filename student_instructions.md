# Student instructions

This documents contains general information about the use of DOMjudge in the course that you can use to test your solutions.

* As a student you should have received on your student mail the user credentials and the url of the DOMjudge server.
* After logging in you can submit your source code (you can select multiple files) for a given problem. 
  If your solution fails, you can see what went wrong on the sample test cases. [^1]
* The time limits for the problems are language-dependent, so you should be able to write a correct solution 
  for any sufficiently efficient algorithm in any of the available languages.
* The scoreboard exists because DOMjudge is made for programming contests, but you can ignore it here. 
  The only thing that matters is whether or not your solution passes all test cases for a problem. [^2]
* Do not use the clarification request system in DOMjudge, but just send us an email if you have any questions or issues.


 [^1]: If you cannot figure out your mistake, feel free to contact us.
 
 [^2]: In programming contests, the winner is determined by first the number of problems solved and then the sum of submission times for correct problems (plus time penalties for incorrect solutions).
